# Random users web app

Data source: https://randomuser.me/

This project using Next.js 14 with Server Actions, so the way that react-query is being used is following the [TanStack Query Docs - Advance SSR](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/advanced-ssr).
Have in account that this Next app is using App Router, NOT Pages Router.

Also I'm using TailwindCSS for styles so I can go a little bit faster developing.

To clone the project use `git clone https://github.com/luiferg/prueba-tecnica-randomusers.git`

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies

Then run `npm run dev` to be able to interact with the project at `http://localhost:3000/`
